# 💼 Portfolio of HTML, CSS, & JS Projects
Welcome to my collection of web projects! This repository showcases a variety of web applications and website recreations that I have built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It is a work-in-progress portfolio, and you can view the live versions of these projects hosted on GitHub Pages.

## 📌 Overview
This repository is divided into two main categories:

### 🧩 1. App Projects
These are web applications that I have conceptualized and built from scratch using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects demonstrate my ability to develop functional and interactive web apps with only frontend technologies.

### 🎨 2. Recreations
In this section, you'll find my attempts at recreating existing websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (and occasionally Bootstrap). This helps me refine my skills while trying to mimic the functionality and design of popular websites.

## 🌐 Live Demos
This repository is hosted on GitHub Pages. You can easily access the live version portfolio by clicking on the following link:
